snippets
========
HTML snippet library for generative applications.

## WTF

* A snippet is the last component of a framework.
* It is the snippet and not component that makes the page.
* Snippets are the forlorn heroes of the code world.
* Snippets are both, one step short of components, and their supersets.

* Snippets are a community effort. They are the Artist's Sketch.
* Artists are busy people they will not always be able to give their snippets the exposure it deserves.
* Snippets Expire, as frameworks and CSS systems alter over time.

* Here stands a repository of snippets.
* It is equipped to evolve over a long stretch of time giving proper credit to creators and those that expand upon their works.

## Usage
run ```bower install https://github.com/regenerate/snippets.git```
and use either ```bower_components/snippets/database.json``` or ```bower_components/snippets/database/*```
```
#tip: testing prior to commit can be staged as follows
# cd ../snippets/; node build.js; cd ../random/; cp ../snippets/database.json ./bower_components/snippets/
```

## Compilation Steps
* Run build in the main directory, it will clobber the ./database.json
